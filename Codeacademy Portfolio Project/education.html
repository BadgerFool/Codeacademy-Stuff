        <p>Oh dear, I hoped you weren't going to click this tab.</p>
        <p>So, I had an "interesting" childhood, and long story short I left comprehensive school in 1996 with very mediocre GCSE results.</p>
        <p>In the following years between very low paying unskilled labour type jobs, I attended a few courses in an attempt to find something I could make a career out of. I did courses from an NVQ in vehicle maintenance to a <a id="gnvq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_National_Vocational_Qualification">GNVQ Advanced</a> in Hospitatlity and catering that I got half way through before realising it wasn't for me.</p>
        <p>After that life sort of took over, I went from job to job, everything from warehouse and factory work, through mobile phone repair and even refuse collection.</p>
        <p>At the moment I am hoping that this new hobby of mine can turn into qualifications in the future so that I could finally do something I enjoy!</p>
